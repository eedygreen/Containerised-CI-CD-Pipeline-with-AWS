## Container Cluster
This clusters are two types, the Blue cluster and Green Cluster. Both clusters are up and running but only one cluster is serving at time, a failure of one will cause the other to switch. 
But in the Blue-Green Deployment, there is a delay because it require human intervention for successful switch to complete.
